# Spark

Are protests too hard to attend?  
Are you not a fan of riding a bike through the city centre?  
Are the gas prices making you rethink heading to Ljubljana with your tractor?  
Boy, do we have a solution for you!  
✨**Spark!** ✨  
Spark is the next generation... of political participation.  
Protesting is a lot easier and a lot more fun on twitter.  
But... forming thoughts is hard. Whoooo neeeds it?? 


Simply authenticate your twitter account, tell us what you want to protest about, and we will post tweets for you. Mentioning all the relevant politicians, and using the appropriate hashtags along the way. Not stopping until either the politicians break, or quit twitter. Or we run out of money.


The downfall of society has never been so painless.


## What we do?
Spark is a web app to protest online with the power of Twitter. Log in with your account and pick a topic you care about. Spark will generate a tweet with ChatGPT and tag relavant politicians. Then posts it a couple of times to amplify your voice.

## Final notes
This project was made as part of a hackaton and is not a serious project. Please don't ping Joe Biden or the white house - it get's you banned for some reason. We take no responsabiliy if using this puts you on the FBI watch list
